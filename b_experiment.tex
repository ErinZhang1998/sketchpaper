% \paragraph{Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)}
% ``Structural information is the idea that the pixels have strong inter-dependencies especially when they are spatially close.''
% ``Luminance masking is a phenomenon whereby image distortions (in this context) tend to be less visible in bright regions, while contrast masking is a phenomenon whereby distortions become less visible where there is significant activity or \textit{texture} in the image.''

\subsection{Analysis}
If we input \textit{large wings} versus \textit{small wings}, we will be able to see that the network can predict the difference between: .
